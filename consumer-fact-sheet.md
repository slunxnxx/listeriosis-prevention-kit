# Listeriosis Prevention: Consumer Fact Sheet

## What is Listeriosis?
Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by the bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes*. It primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.

## Who is at High Risk?
- **Pregnant women** – can pass infection to unborn baby, leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe illness in newborns
- **Adults aged 65 and older**
- **People with weakened immune systems** – due to cancer treatments, organ transplants, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, kidney disease, etc.
- **Newborns** – infected during pregnancy or delivery

## High-Risk Foods to Avoid
- **Unpasteurized (raw) milk and soft cheeses** made from unpasteurized milk (e.g., feta, Brie, Camembert, blue‑veined cheeses)
- **Ready‑to‑eat deli meats and hot dogs** – unless heated until steaming hot (≥165°F)
- **Refrigerated pâtés or meat spreads**
- **Refrigerated smoked seafood** (e.g., salmon, trout, whitefish, cod) – unless it is canned or shelf‑stable, or cooked thoroughly
- **Raw or undercooked sprouts**
- **Melons** that have been cut and left at room temperature
- **Pre‑packaged salads** (unless washed again immediately before eating)

## Safe Food Handling Practices
1. **Keep Cold Foods Cold**
   - Refrigerator temperature: 40°F (4°C) or below
   - Freezer temperature: 0°F (–18°C) or below
   - Use a refrigerator thermometer to monitor.

2. **Cook Thoroughly**
   - Cook raw meat, poultry, and seafood to safe internal temperatures:
     - Poultry: 165°F (74°C)
     - Ground meats: 160°F (71°C)
     - Beef, pork, lamb, veal (steaks, roasts, chops): 145°F (63°C) with a 3‑minute rest
   - Reheat leftovers and ready‑to‑eat foods until steaming hot (≥165°F).

3. **Prevent Cross‑Contamination**
   - Wash hands, utensils, cutting boards, and countertops with hot, soapy water after handling raw foods.
   - Keep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs separate from ready‑to‑eat foods.
   - Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and produce.

4. **Clean Produce**
   - Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, cutting, or cooking.
   - Scrub firm produce (e.g., melons, cucumbers) with a clean brush.

5. **Store Foods Properly**
   - Use leftovers within 3–4 days.
   - Follow “use‑by” dates on packaged foods.
   - Keep your refrigerator clean and discard any spoiled or recalled items.

## Special Advice for High‑Risk Groups
- **Pregnant women**: Avoid high‑risk foods entirely. Do not eat deli meats or hot dogs unless heated until steaming hot. Do not eat soft cheeses unless labeled “made with pasteurized milk.”
- **Older adults and immunocompromised individuals**: Be extra vigilant about refrigeration, cooking temperatures, and avoiding high‑risk foods.

## Symptoms of Listeriosis
- Fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, convulsions
- Pregnant women may experience mild flu‑like symptoms, but infection can lead to severe pregnancy complications.
- Symptoms can appear from a few days to several weeks after eating contaminated food.

## When to Seek Medical Attention
Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you:
- Are pregnant and develop fever and flu‑like symptoms
- Have a weakened immune system and develop fever, headache, stiff neck, or confusion
- Have eaten a recalled food and develop symptoms
